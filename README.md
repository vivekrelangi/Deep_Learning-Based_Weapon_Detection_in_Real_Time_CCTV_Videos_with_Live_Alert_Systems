# Deep_Learning-Based_Weapon_Detection_in_Real_Time_CCTV_Videos_with_Live_Alert_Systems
The project is a deep learning-based system for real-time weapon detection in CCTV videos with live alert systems. The system utilizes computer vision and deeplearning techniques to detect and recognize weapons in surveillance videos, enabling early warning and rapid response to potential threats. The projectemploys a deep learning-based approach to detect weapons in real-time CCTV videos. The system consists of three stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, and detection. The preprocessing stage involves resizing and normalizing the video frames. The feature extraction stage uses convolutional neural networks to extract relevant features from the video frames. The detection stage uses a model trained using YOLO algorithm to identify weapons in the video frames.
